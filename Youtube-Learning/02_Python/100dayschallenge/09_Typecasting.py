# Examples of Data types like: int(), float(), str(), ord(), hex(), oct(), tuple(), set(), list(), dict(), etc.



#Dont write integers in "" python will read it as string python will add them side by side like "ansh"+"pethe" = anshpethe

a = 1
b = 2 
print(a + b)# output : 3 


#Example of integers as string 
a1 = "1"
b1 = "2"
print(a1+b1)#output : 12 


# Two Types of Typecasting:

#Explicit Conversion (Explicit type casting in python)
#Implicit Conversion (Implicit type casting in python)


# 1. Explicit Conversion (by user as manually)


#if they are strings and we want to convert in integers so,
a2 = "1"
b2 = "2"
print(int(a) + int(b))#output : 3 (becouse typecasting)


# 2. Implicit Conversion 
c = 1.9
d = 8
print(c+d) 
# output is 9.9 becouse python is automatically converted to float integer that's why implicit conversion is called automatic by python
